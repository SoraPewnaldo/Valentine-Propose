# 💖 Valentine's Day Proposal Page

A beautiful, interactive, and responsive web page designed for a special Valentine's Day proposal. This project features a playful "Yes/No" interaction where the "Yes" button grows larger with every "No" attempt, eventually taking over the screen!

## ✨ Features

- **🌸 Aesthetic UI:** Modern glassmorphism design with a soft pastel gradient background.
- **📱 Fully Responsive:** Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
- **🎈 Floating Animations:** Dynamic background with floating hearts and sparkles.
- **🎮 Interactive Logic:**
  - "No" button changes text and shakes on click.
  - "Yes" button grows significantly with each "No" click.
  - A hidden celebratory page once they finally say "Yes!"
- **🎨 Premium Typography:** Uses 'Dancing Script' for a romantic, handwritten feel.
