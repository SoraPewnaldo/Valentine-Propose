# 💖 Valentine's Day Proposal Page

A beautiful, interactive, and responsive web page designed for a special Valentine's Day proposal. This project features a playful "Yes/No" interaction where the "Yes" button grows larger with every "No" attempt, eventually taking over the screen!

- **🎮 Interactive Logic:**
  - "No" button features a long sequence of playful, persuasive messages.
  - "Yes" button grows significantly with each "No" click until it fills the screen.

## 🎨 How to Customize

I've added `CUSTOMIZE` markers throughout the code to help you make it your own. Simply open the files and search for the word **CUSTOMIZE** to find where to:
- Change the **Music** (`index.html` & `yes_page.html`)
- Edit the **Proposal Text** (`index.html`)
- Update the **"No" Button Messages** (`script.js`)
- Swap the **GIFs** (`index.html` & `yes_page.html`)
- Change the **Colors** (`styles.css` & `yes_style.css`)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML5** - Structure
- **CSS3** - Styling & Animations (Glassmorphism, Flexbox)
